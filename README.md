# SARC Website
This is my assigment submission for question 1 of the web portfolio Assigment.

# Description

This website is a very distilled version of a sarc website

Choice of this as the theme is because it is most relevant and can later be linked with a DJango backend to add events and details

Most of my attention was to CSS using fancy lights and styles especially for cards

I have used Cards as a component with some basic description and hypothetical events
